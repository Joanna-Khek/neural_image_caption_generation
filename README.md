# Neural Image Caption Generation
This project is a reproduction of the paper [**Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044)

## Project Requirement
Your project will be based on understanding, reproducing, and extending one recent research paper on deep learning published in a reputable machine learning publication avenue, an example list of which will be provided in Section 3. Your goal is to understand the technical content of the paper, reproduce the main results, and extend some of the results presented in the paper. For application or algorithm papers, reproducing means coding up your own implementation of the methodologies introduced there. You are expected to explore different datasets and/or architectures than what is presented in the paper to fully evaluate the methodologies. For theoretical papers, reproducing means a complete exposition of the proof of the main result(s). Note that copy-paste of all the proofs is not accepted.
